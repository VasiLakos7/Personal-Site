        <h1 class="main-text">In my spare time, I like to collect old objects, called antiques. This is a way to be able to keep in touch with the old world as well as compare it to new objects.
            Also, old items can be collectibles either now or in a few years and you can sell them at a high price.
            Furthermore, I like to programming. By programming, I learn new methods that can help me in my Dream Job.
